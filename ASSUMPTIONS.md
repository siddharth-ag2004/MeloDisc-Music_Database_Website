1.Some fonts may not appear on the webpage, it varies from system to system.

2.Our website has been made keeping Lenovo Legion 5's specifications in mind. Running on other laptops(like Lenovo Ideapad 5,although it has same specifications as Legion) might result in certain images getting stretched and/or text overlapping with images, which is not the case. If this happens, zooming out the screen by around 75%-80% might fix the problem.

3.When hovering cursor over Top Songs we have made them interactable, but when clicked, they do not direct the user to any page, implying they are not clickable.

4.We have assumed that we have to search for top 10 results first(as mentioned in the pdf), and then filter them if and when the user applies the filters. So applying filters may display less than 10 songs.

5.In some cases, like when the internet connection is slow, or when the search button is pressed continuosly, the webpage may display more than 10 songs. Pressing Search again or relaoding, should fix the problem and 10 results are displayed.
